\description{
\code{Gridworld} creates gridworld environments.

\details{
A gridworld is an episodic navigation task, the goal is to get from start state to goal state.

Possible actions include going left, right, up or down. If \code{diagonal.moves = TRUE} diagonal
moves are also possible, leftup, leftdown, rightup and rightdown.

When stepping into a cliff state you get a reward of \code{reward.cliff},
usually a high negative reward and transition to a state specified by \code{cliff.transition.states}.

In each column a deterministic wind specified via \code{wind} pushes you up a specific number of
grid cells (for the next action).

A stochastic gridworld is a gridworld where with probability \code{stochasticity} the next state
is chosen at random from all neighbor states independent of the actual action.

If an action would take you off the grid, the new state is the nearest cell inside the grid.
For each step you get a reward of \code{reward.step}, until you reach a goal state,
then the episode is done.

States are enumerated row-wise and numeration starts with 0.
Here is an example 4x4 grid:
\tabular{rrrr}{
 0 \tab 1 \tab 2 \tab 3 \cr
 4 \tab 5 \tab 6 \tab 7 \cr
 8 \tab 9 \tab 10 \tab 11 \cr
 12 \tab 13 \tab 14 \tab 15 \cr
}
So a board position could look like this (G: goal state, x: current state, C: cliff state):
\tabular{rrrr}{
 G \tab o \tab o \tab o \cr
 o \tab o \tab o \tab o \cr
 o \tab x \tab o \tab o \cr
 o \tab o \tab o \tab C \cr
}
}
\section{Usage}{

\code{Gridworld$new(shape = NULL, goal.states = NULL, cliff.states = NULL,
  reward.step = -1, reward.cliff = -100, diagonal.moves = FALSE, wind = rep(0, shape[2]),
  cliff.transition.states = NULL, cliff.transition.done = FALSE, stochasticity = 0, ...)}
}

\section{Methods}{

\code{$new()} Initializes a new environment.

\code{$reset()} Starts a new episode.
Returns the \code{state}.

\code{$step(action)} Take action in environment.
Returns a list with \code{state}, \code{reward}, \code{done}.

\code{$visualize()} Visualizes environment.
