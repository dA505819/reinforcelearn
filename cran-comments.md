## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the Description field in DESCRIPTION to include references to relevant papers.
* Removed tests which used code from lintr.

## Test environments
* local x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit), R 3.4.3
* linux_gnu x_86_64, R Under development (unstable) (2017-12-22 r73943) on travis-ci

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* New submission

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
