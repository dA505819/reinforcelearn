[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markdumke/reinforcelearn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markdumke/reinforcelearn)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  message = FALSE,
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markdumke/reinforcelearn")
```

----

### Get started

Reinforcement Learning with the package `reinforcelearn` is as easy as

```{r}
library(reinforcelearn)

# Create gridworld environment
env = windyGridworld()

# Solve environment using Sarsa
res = sarsa(env, n.episodes = 50)
print(res$steps)
```

----

### Environments

With `makeEnvironment` you can create a reinforcement learning environment from a Markov Decision Process.

```{r}
# Create environment from MDP.
P = array(0, c(2,2,2))
P[, , 1] = matrix(c(0.2, 0.8, 0, 1), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
P[, , 2] = matrix(c(0.1, 0.9, 0, 1), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
R = matrix(c(5, 10, -1, 2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)  
env = makeEnvironment(transitions = P, rewards = R)
```

The environment is an `R6` class with a set of attributes and methods.
You can interact with the environment via the `reset` and `step` method.

```{r}
# Reset environment.
env$reset()
print(env)

# Take action 0.
env$step(0)
print(env)
```

You can also create an environment from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). You need to install all dependencies listed [here](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api).
Then you can use an environment with the name.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create Gym environment.
# Note: There is a bug: The following line might return an error. 
# If so, repeat this line, then it should work.
MountainCar = makeEnvironment("MountainCar-v0")

MountainCar$reset()
# take random actions for 200 steps
for (i in 1:200) {
  action = sample(MountainCar$actions, 1)
  MountainCar$step(action)
}
MountainCar$close()
```

This should open a Python window showing the interaction with the environment.

For more details on how to create an environment have a look at the vignette: [How to create an environment?](vignettes/environments.html)

### Algorithms

After you created an environment you can use various reinforcement learning algorithms to sovle this environment. For example, for a tabular environment like  gridworld you can use tabular Q-Learning to solve it and find the optimal action value function $Q*$. You can set various parameters like the learning rate, the number of episodes, the discount factor or epsilon.

```{r}
# Create the windy gridworld environment.
env = windyGridworld()
res = qlearning(env, n.episodes = 50)
print(res$steps)

# Show value of each state.
print(matrix(round(apply(res$Q1, 1, max), 1), ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE))
```

We can then get the optimal policy by taking the argmax over the action value function Q.

```{r}
optimal.policy = max.col(res$Q1) - 1L
print(matrix(optimal.policy, ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE))
```

For more details on algorithms have a look at the vignette: [How to solve an environment?](algorithms.html)

### Value function approximation

When the state space is large or even continuous tabular solution methods cannot be applied. Then it is better to approximate the value function using a function approximator. We need to define a function, which preprocesses the state observation, so that the function approximator can work with it.
Here is an example solving the mountain car problem using linear function approximation. 

```{r}
# Set up the Mountain Car problem
m = MountainCar()

# Define preprocessing function (here grid tiling)
n.tilings = 8
max.size = 4096
iht = IHT(max.size)

position.max = m$state.space.bounds[[1]][2]
position.min = m$state.space.bounds[[1]][1]
velocity.max = m$state.space.bounds[[2]][2]
velocity.min = m$state.space.bounds[[2]][1]
position.scale = n.tilings / (position.max - position.min)
velocity.scale = n.tilings / (velocity.max - velocity.min)

preprocessState = function(state) {
  # scale state observation
  state = matrix(c(position.scale * state[1], velocity.scale * state[2]), ncol = 2)
  # get active tiles
  active.tiles = tiles(iht, 8, state)
  # return n hot vector with 1 at the position of each active tile
  makeNHot(active.tiles, max.size)
}

set.seed(123)
res = qlearning(m, fun.approx = "linear", 
  preprocessState = preprocessState, n.episodes = 30)
print(res$steps)
```
